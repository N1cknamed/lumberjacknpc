[c/03FCAD:Description]

Adds a simple new town NPC that sells all types of wood. He will move in after EoC is defeated. When the world enters Hardmode he will begin selling pearlwood. He also sells a bunch of other wood related items that you will have to see for yourself (or read the forum post).

This NPC will sell you [i/s1:183] after all 3 mech bosses have been defeated, to reduce the grind for shroomite armor. It is still recommended to set up a farm as buying enough mushrooms to craft all shroomite gear will cost nearly 12 platinum.

This is my first mod, so bugs might occur. If you have found any bugs, or if you want a more detailed description, you can do so on the forum post.
