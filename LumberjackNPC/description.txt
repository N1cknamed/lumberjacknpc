Adds a simple lumberjack npc that sells wood. Will move in after EoC is defeated. Sells Pearlwood when the world enters Hardmode. Also sells a bunch of other related items. A more detailed description can be found on the forum post.

This is my first mod, so bugs might occur. Please leave your feedback on the forums.
